# Dragon-Real-Estates

  This project predicts housing prices using machine learning techniques. It is designed to help real estate professionals estimate property prices based on key features like location, number of rooms, tax rates, and more.

Overview:

    The Dragon Real Estate Price Predictor is built using Python and scikit-learn. It processes real estate data to train a model capable of predicting property prices. The project focuses on:
    
    - Data preprocessing (handling missing values, feature scaling).
    - Model training and evaluation using cross-validation.
    - Saving the trained model for future use.

Features

    - Data Exploration: Insights into data distribution and correlation.
    - Pipeline Creation: Automates data preprocessing tasks.
    - Model Selection: Trains multiple algorithms, including:
      - Linear Regression
      - Decision Tree Regressor
      - Random Forest Regressor
    - Evaluation: Measures model performance using RMSE and cross-validation.
    - Model Deployment: Saves and tests the model on unseen data.

Technologies Used

    - Python: Programming language.
    - scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.
    - pandas: Data manipulation.
    - matplotlib: Data visualization.
    - joblib: Model serialization.
